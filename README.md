## Clone

Clone the repository from GitHub:
sh
git clone https://github.com/mbackhouse18/scdaa-dgm-pde-solver


## Usage

Each exercise is contained within a folder with the respective section of the SCDAA Coursework.
Within each folder (1,2,3 or 4), run the main_i-j.py file, where i = 1,2,3,4 and j = 1,2.

For example, to run exercise 2.1, run the file main_2-1.py within the folder 2 within the folder 2.1.
The same logic follows for each exercise.
