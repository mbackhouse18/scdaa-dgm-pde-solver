## Description

A numerical algorithm for solving stochastic control problems using policy iteration combined with the “deep Galerkin method” (DGM) for solving a linear PDE. 

## Clone

Clone the repository from GitHub:
sh
git clone https://github.com/mbackhouse18/scdaa-dgm-pde-solver


## Usage

Each exercise is contained within a folder with the respective section of the SCDAA Coursework (e.g. Section 1 is in the folder labelled "1" and so on).
Within each folder (1,2,3 or 4), run the main_i-j.py file, where i = 1,2,3,4 and j = 1,2.

For example, to run exercise 2.1, run the file main_2-1.py within the folder 2. To run exercise 1.2, open the folder 1 and run main_1-1.py.

This is the same for all exercises. Please note however, that exercise 3 is a .ipynb (a jupyter notebook). Therefore, exercise 3 cannot be ran in exactly the same ways as all the other .py files. To run exercise 3, please run each cell of the main_3.ipynb file. 

Note: Some code that reproduces graphs and tables is commented out to allow the user to more easily choose which section of the code they wish to run as some of the code runs slowly. The code is well documented and it is easily noticable which code is necessary to comment out to reproduce graphs and output that is stated in the report.
