## Description

A numerical algorithm for solving stochastic control problems using policy iteration combined with the “deep Galerkin method” (DGM) for solving a linear PDE. 

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
sh
git clone https://github.com/xxxxx


2. Install the dependencies using environment.yaml:
sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml


3. Activate the environment:
sh
conda activate --


## Usage
Need to tell them how to run it
